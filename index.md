## Biography

I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.
My research focuses on the mathematical and statistical foundations of sequential decision making systems. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor
Shangtong Zhang as a member of the Sequential Decision Making Lab.
Previously, I received my Masters in CS and BA in Physics and CS with Highest Distinction also from UVA.
