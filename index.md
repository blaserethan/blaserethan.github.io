## Biography

I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, and an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.
My research focuses on the mathematical and statistical foundations of sequential decision making systems. I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor
Shangtong Zhang.
Prior to that, I received my Masters in CS at UVA and a BA in Physics and CS with Highest Distinction also from UVA.
